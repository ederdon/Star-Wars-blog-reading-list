# StarWars Blog Reading List

## Description

This project is a Blog where you can find information about Star Wars. I make it using React.js, Flux, Router. All of this with bootstrap and getting the information using fetch from the API. 

The information loaded is saved locally to be shown when refresehing the page and reduce the callings to the API.
You can delete this local information by clicking the red heart on the footer.
